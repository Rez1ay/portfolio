Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds.
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds.
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds.
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Strategically located to serve harbours along the South African coastline, Link should be your first port of call when looking for a full-service chandlery company that can get the job done quickly, effectively and at the right price. To help speed up the procurement and delivery process Link is also able to handle transactions in multiple currencies for the following services:

-Replenishment at Sea
For vessels that are unable to dock, but are holding off South African ports, Link also offers a replenishment at sea service. This is done through the use of seagoing barges or helicopters, but only when it makes economic sense for the client.
It must be noted that all of the ship chandlery services offered outside of Cape Town are on an “on demand” basis only. This simply means that Link does not have a permanent representative in ports outside of Cape Town Harbour and does not affect the service levels provided. When Link commits, Link delivers!"

This experience was first established in support of our own 400 Crane Rental Fleet and later with the wire rope lubrication systems developed to maintain those cranes load lines, pendants, and boom hoist cables. The Kirkpatrick Group, Inc. has been the manufacturer of wire rope lubrication equipment for almost three decades. We developed the first successful wire rope lubrication system in the world for our own use in 1982. Therefore, our reputation and field experience far exceeds any other producer of similar equipment because it was developed around our own requirements. No other producer can make this claim.
Kirkpatrick Wire Rope Lubrication Systems are excellent for Wire Rope & Cable Lubrication/Cleaning. In only one application wire rope can have its surface and groove pattern scraped clean of product build-up and grit while at the same time new lubricant is uniformly applied to the newly cleaned surface. Coating product then fills any open spaces within the groove pattern and internal strands open to receive it. This is accomplished as the wire rope passes through a controlled 100% pressurized immersion within the internal Seal Lubrication Chamber. Surface moisture trapped within the internal strands is displaced and replaced with the newly applied wire rope coating product. Systems are functional with both low and high viscosity coatings. They can be incorporated as a Grease Applicator for tough applications where higher viscosity coatings are required to fight friction wear due to strand rubbing as well as a low viscosity oiling system required for certain Cable Cleaning & Lubrication applications."

For this reason, the time of reaction and response must be reduced.

MAS provides in just a few seconds a strong ballistic protection against pirate attacks.
Our special armor roller shutters easily adapt to all sort of doorways, corridors and windows, blocking the access to neuralgic areas of the vessel in times of greatest risk.

Once the armor system is activated it provides the ship with an effective bulletproof protection that will help prevent the kidnap of the crew and will help deter any attempt of intrusion in the protected areas and the hijacking of the vessel by the pirates.

MAS is also a very useful tool for private security companies, as it will make their job a lot easier and efficient, allowing them to focus on saving lives instead of securing each area, door by door.

MAS meets the most demanding standards, offering different security levels. The extraordinary resistance of our ballistic blinds guarantees maximum protection, even against military weapons of the highest caliber.

MAS fulfills the levels stipulated by the armor ballistic standards, and it has successfully passed laboratory tests and stress tests set by international institutions.

In accordance with the European Standards UNE-EN 1627:2011 and UNE-EN 1522:1999 we offer different security and armor levels."

I would like to introduce ourselves to the community of Fleet Moon, whenever viewers/owners are bringing vessels to load/discharge goods at Paranagua port in Brazil,

Brazilian Federal Government has only stabilished the rules for the sludge retrieval from Ocean vessel two years ago, and took us/our companies almost
1,5 (one and a half year) to get all needed permissions and licences to perform this service at Paranagua port.

our companies below, are 100% able and certified by all responsible Port, Environmental and Customs authorities to perform the retrieval of oil residues from Ocean vessels using that port, and we prefer direct contact with shipowners management/HQ in order to give more transparence to all steps/procedures/operations, from planning in advance the operation with the expected tonnage to be retrieved.

Our retrieval operation is performed while vessel is berthed, loading or discharging goods.


we suggest RS 300,00 (tree hundred reais, about usd 125,00) price for the complete service, which includes the official certification (Marpol) to owners for proper disposal of oil residues
